## My process
I started by structuring the HTML with semantic elements and containers to organize content and support reusable CSS classes. After completing the HTML, I applied a CSS reset:

```
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
Then, I defined spacing for the .content-container and used `margin-bottom` on each section to create clear visual separation.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned
During this project, I learned about the default behaviors of box-sizing and list-style-position, as well as key concepts of responsive web design. I focused on trying to write maintainable CSS and ensuring the layout adapted well to different screen sizes. It's not perfact still but I will working on it. This was also my first time building a webpage with the goal of closely matching a static JPG design.
